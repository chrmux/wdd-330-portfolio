        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Use this app to create a pacing guide that will work for you.  Include any activity on this guide that relates to your ability to complete the requirements of your schoolwork every week. This should include studying, but it can also include activities that are impacted by your studying. In short, write a pacing guide that will help you plan your weekly time so you can succeed in your courses.

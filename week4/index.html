            <ul>
                <li>Forms</li>
                <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <p>When it comes to forms, there are plenty of usability and accessibility considerations to keep in mind, such as using correct and semantic markup, making forms keyboard accessible and using WAI-AIRA labels. Most of these fall outside the scope of this book, as we'll be keeping the focus on how to use JavaScript to interact with the forms.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
                <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.
                    <br>
                    The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Modern JavaScript</li>
                <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <p><strong>Dollar Symbols</strong>
                    <br> The jQuery library uses the $ symbol as a convenient alias for the the global jQuery object that contains all of jQuery's methods. This prevents the global scope from being polluted with any of jQuery’s methods. The $ symbol has become synonymous with jQuery, and you can confidently expect that any mention of it implies that jQuery is being used.</p>
